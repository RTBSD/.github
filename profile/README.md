# RTBSD

RTBSD (RTOS + BSD) is an environment specifically designed for embedded system development. It integrates an RTOS kernel with BSD driver components. This environment is mainly targeted at microprocessor unit (MPU) systems equipped with a memory management unit (MMU), covering architectures such as ARM64, x86, and RISCV64. These systems can obtain excellent driver support under general-purpose operating systems like FreeBSD and Linux, especially for complex buses such as USB and PCIe. However, real-time operating systems (RTOS) often lack support for these complex bus drivers. With RTBSD, developers can seamlessly integrate mature driver components from UNIX-like general-purpose systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD into the RTOS kernel, significantly enhancing the driver capabilities of the real-time operating system.
